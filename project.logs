// Colors
A well-designed website usually includes these three key types of colors:
1. Dark Color (Base/Primary): 
    Used for backgrounds, text, or navbar to create depth eg. bg-gray-800, bg-slate-900, text-gray-200
2. Light Color (Secondary): 
    Used for contrast, sections, or soft backgrounds eg. bg-gray-300, bg-slate-100, text-gray-900
3. Accent Color (Highlight):
    Used for buttons, links, hover effects, or branding elements eg.bg-orange-400, bg-blue-500, text-emerald-500

// Workflow
For a portfolio website, we want to focus on showcasing your skills, projects, and experience in a clean and professional manner. Here's a suggestion for the structure and pages:

1. Home Page:
    Purpose: This is the first page visitors will see, so it should give an introduction to who you are.
    Key Elements:
        Brief introduction (name, profession, tagline).
        A call-to-action (CTA) like "See My Work" or "Contact Me."
        Links to your social media, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.
        A clean and minimal design to make the site easy to navigate.
2. About Me Page:
    Purpose: Provide more details about yourself, your background, and your journey.
    Key Elements:
        Your biography: where you're from, your education, what drives you, etc.
        Skills summary: MERN stack, other tools, and technologies.
        Personal statement or philosophy about development.
        A picture or a video introduction (optional).
3. Projects Page:
    Purpose: Display your best work and show the skills you've used in real projects.
    Key Elements:
        A list of your top 3-5 projects with brief descriptions, tech stack, and challenges you faced.
        Links to live versions or repositories (GitHub).
        Screenshots or demo videos of each project.
        If possible, add a filter option (e.g., by technology used or type of project).
4. Resume Page:
    Purpose: Provide a detailed view of your work experience, education, and skills.
    Key Elements:
        A downloadable PDF version of your resume.
        A section with your professional experience, skills, and education.
        Awards, certifications, or accomplishments.
5. Contact Page:
    Purpose: Make it easy for people to reach out to you.
    Key Elements:
        A contact form: Name, Email, Message.
        Social media links again (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.).
        An embedded map or other ways to contact you directly.
6. Blog (Optional):
    Purpose: Share your thoughts, tutorials, or experiences.
    Key Elements:
        Posts about your journey as a developer, challenges you've overcome, or tech-related insights.
        Maybe tutorials or guides related to MERN stack or the latest technologies you've worked with.
        Design Considerations:
        Dark Mode/Light Mode toggle: Since you prefer dark mode, this is something to consider as an optional feature for users.
        Responsive Design: Ensure your site is mobile-friendly and accessible on all devices.
        Smooth Animations: Use libraries like Framer Motion to add subtle transitions and hover effects to make your website feel interactive.
        Fast Load Time: Use tools like image optimization and lazy loading for better performance.
